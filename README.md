# whack

A collection of tools and other hacky things I've made for myself. User beware!

* galliumhook - injects `mercuryhook.dll` (whatever that may be) forces created windows to be 1080x1920 regardless of screen resolution
* Translation/WTT - translation tool that exports message tables to and imports from toml files [(readme)](WTT/README.md)
