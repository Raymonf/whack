# whack

A collection of tools and other hacky (read: ugly) things I've made for myself, designed for Arcade Gameâ„¢. User beware!

* galliumhook - injects `mercuryhook.dll` (whatever that may be) and forces created windows to be 1080x1920 regardless of screen resolution
* WTT - translation tool that exports message tables to and imports from toml files [(readme)](WTT/README.md)
* MercuryPatcher - web UI that applies some patches, derived from BemaniPatcher [(go there)](https://raymonf.github.io/whack/MercuryPatcher/)

### Changelog

* 11/8/2022: WTT has received an update that will impact your workflow if you're using this tool. See the tool's readme for more details.
